Hey all,

Short update today. Basically just fixed all the bugs from the last post, and put it up on the [Baker Street Heists page](../baker-street). At this point is _seems_  like the rules are all good. There probably will be a couple more small tweaks, but I'm not sure what those might be at this point. Commence Testing! And art. Def need art. Don't worry. It's coming. :)
