Hey all! [Duadikos.com](../) is officially official now. Yay! Pillars of Ardalith is the first product, which includes a prebuilt world setting (Ardalith) and a unique new tabletop RPG system ([DOTT](../dott/)). This is just the beginning, so expect many more interactive entertainment morsels to come (of all genres), as well as constant improvements on existing ones. We will also have a periodic post of the story [Leaving Lucerna](../dott/pillars/leaving_lucerna) (written by Redbeard). We hope you enjoy!
