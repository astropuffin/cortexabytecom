Hey all! I hope you are all enjoying a great new year. Boston (our home base) is all snowed in, but we're still cranking away to deliver great games. December was a bit of a slow month (it's hard to get people to playtest with all these holidays), but we still managed to crank out some improvements. Pillars of Ardalith [spell system](../dott#/136) got legit organized, as opposed to being a total jumble. Traits also got a bit of an improvment, and I threw out the old mess of a system there. We also made some huge speed improvements to the site, and it's noticably faster. We're still cranking up our metric engines, so I don't have any hard numbers for you. We plan to have a new product for you in January to enjoy, a detective card game. As always, there's a [new chapter](../../story/leaving-lucerna/chapter-3-the-scavenger) of Leaving Lucerna this month.

I got myself a new development computer this last month (Surface Pro), so I've been ramping up on Unity3D. That's allowed me to restart work on a new project that's been bouncing around my brain for two years now. More details on that in the coming months.
