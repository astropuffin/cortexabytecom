Hey all! This month we released the public beta of [Baker Street Heists](../baker-street)! It's a [werewolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) type card game (if you're familiar with those) where Moriarty and Sherlock are leading teams against each other for fun and profit! The playtesters have been having fun (so far), so check it out and let us know what you think. On the Leaving Lucerna front, the [last chapter](../story/leaving-lucerna/chapter-3-the-scavenger) was a little lacking so I lengthed it, and there is a [new exciting chapter](../story/leaving-lucerna/chapter-4-beneath-the-gentle-arborways) for you to feast your eyes on.
