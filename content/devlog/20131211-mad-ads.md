Hey all! Today is the first day that we started seeing ads on the site, so I wanted to explain what that was all about. Here at Duadikos, our business strategy is to provide "free" content (as much as possible). While it won't cost you any money to play the core components of our games, there is a different kind of cost: ad provider networks track user visits. We are currently using AdSense, and you can choose to opt outÂ [here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads). As always, if you have concerns about anything on the site, please click the feedback button. Thanks!
