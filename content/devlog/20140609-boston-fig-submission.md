Hey all!  
On Friday I submitted [Baker Street Heists](../baker-street-heists) to [Boston Festival of Indie Games](http://bostonfig.com/)! Hopefully it will make a good showing. The rules are done (again baring any disasterous bugs), and all that's left is polishing up the presentation and packaging. For that I need to do blind playtests, which means all new playtesters every time. I got a ton of feedback on the art that Gosia made, and the results were overwealmingly positive! A few touchups and a change to one image and we're good to go for the Kickstarter. Speaking of which, plans are to have that in September if at all possible, so keep your eyes open for it.

On the electronic front, the base graphics infrastructure is done, and now I'm trying to get a rough draft of the user interface done. Honestly, I've been spending almost all of my time on Baker Street Heists, so I have haven't made a ton of progress. It takes a lot of work to bring a product to life. :/
