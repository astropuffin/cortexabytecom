I did it. After two weeks of grueling editing and tons of feedback from family and friends, I finally managed to upload all the images and order 10 copies of Moriarty's Machinations from thegamecrafter.com. I'm a bit nervous about how the rulebook will be handled, but we'll see. If you are a game reviewer and want a copy please let me know! I should have them to ship out to you around August 11th.
