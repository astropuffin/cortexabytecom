Hey all. Last night I updated the win contitions and team selection dynamic forÂ [Baker Street Heists](../baker-street). I found out (from playtesting) that in a werewolf type game, if you have a leader for each group, there is absolutely no way to have only one team guess. There is just way too much information around, and it's pretty easy to guess Sherlock or Moriarty. So! Back to the original design with simultaneous accusations. I am sooo glad that I playtest early and often. :)
