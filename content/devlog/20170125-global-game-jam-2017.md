Wow, it's been ages since my last post. Well every year I do the Global Game Jam with my best friend [pyromuffin](http://www.pyromuffin.com/) (and usually other folks too). This year's theme was "Wave", so we made a surfing duel game. I think it turned out to be our best game yet! It turned out _way_ more strategic than I think any of us expected. Screenshot below:
